RobotCode
=========

Welcome to the Mad Mouse Software Repository 

Tank Final is the current version of arduino code to go on the robot-commanding arduino.

Lighting Final is the current version of arduino code to go on the secondary lighting arduino.

Versions are named Final to ensure continuity with original file tracking system on my laptop. (This hopefully will be changed once I update that system to Github standards)
